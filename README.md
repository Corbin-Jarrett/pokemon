## Pokemon Game

# This is a simple project game I made using Python and json files. It is heavily inspired by the popular game Pokemon.

The Pokemon.py file has all of the python functions. 

The testing.py file is just for testing ideas and concepts before being added to pokemon.py.

The Users.json is an older file and is also for testing. Corbin.json is for testing execution of the code and is how user data is stored.

Usernames.txt is a list of all the usernames the code has.

pokemon.json is the pokemon data that each pokemon initially has before going to the user account.

main.py is where the UI will be and is where I call all the functions in pokemon.py
