# Pokemon Game

This is a simple project game I made using Python and json files. It is heavily inspired by the popular game Pokemon.

The Pokemon.py file has all of the python code, testing.py is just for testing ideas and concepts.

The Users.json is an older file and is also for testing. Corbin.json is for testing execution of the code and is how user data is stored.

Usernames.txt is a list of all the usernames the code has.
